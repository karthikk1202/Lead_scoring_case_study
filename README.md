# Lead_scoring_case_study
Project Overview:
This project focuses on Lead Scoring for X Education, an online course provider. The goal is to build a Logistic Regression model to predict which leads are most likely to convert into paying customers, improving the company's sales efficiency.

Approach:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, handled categorical variables, and performed feature selection.
EDA & Insights: Identified key features affecting lead conversion (e.g., total time spent on the website).
Model Training & Evaluation: Implemented Logistic Regression, optimized the classification threshold, and evaluated using Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC Score.

Key Findings & Business Impact:
Optimized Model Achieves 91% Accuracy & 0.96 AUC Score.
Lead Scores Help Prioritize High-Potential Customers, improving conversion rates.
Threshold tuning allows flexibilityâ€”adjusting the score can focus on high-value leads or maximize overall conversions.

Final Recommendations:
Sales teams should focus on leads with scores above 80 for higher conversions.
Periodically adjust the threshold based on business goals (volume vs. quality).
Future improvements can explore advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deeper customer segmentation.
